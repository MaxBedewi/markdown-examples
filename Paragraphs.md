# Paragraphs and Line Breaks

## Paragraphs 

**Add a blank line in between lines of text to create
a paragraph:**

'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road 
behind,' said Sam. 

They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented 
them from seeing far. 'I wonder if that is Gandalf 
coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as he said it,
he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire 
to hide from the view of the rider came over him. 

## Line Breaks

**There are two ways to add a line break:** 

1. End a line with two or more spaces 
2. Use the line break HTML tag 

*The Road goes ever on and on  
Down from the door where it began.  
Now far ahead the Road has gone,  
And I must follow, if I can,  
Pursuing it with weary feet,<br>
Until it joins some larger way,<br>
Where many paths and errands meet.<br>
And whither then? I cannot say.<br>*
